## Example

### Headline

FLP Categorizes Case Law to make Searches and Alerts More Powerful

### What is the Feature?

Classification of CL documents by domain, sector, or topic. This could be a new search filter.

### What Problem Might it Solve?

Users who work in specific industries can't easily understand the coverage of documents on CL by domain.

### Describe a Scenario in Which the Feature Might be Used

A tech company is considering using the API. They want to understand CL coverage for their sectors of interest before making the commitment. They might do an advanced search using a "topic" filter for "civil rights," "environmental," or "bankruptcy" (for example).

### Technical Requirements

 - How hard is it to make, subjectively? Easy.
 - Best guess, how long would it take to make, roughly? Two weeks
 - What would it require that we do technically? We would need to frob the throban and expand it to use new fizor tenors.

### Existing Systems or Alternatives?

Acme corp is already doing this. You can see their system here: 

https://xxx.example.com

Ours would be better because it would be free and open.

### Any Additional Information?

- A tech company mentioned that this would be a useful function on [date]. They focus on specific sectors and categorize documents with their own models. It would be helpful for them to understand CL coverage by topic before committing to using the API.
- This could also be used by those who want to follow topic areas (alerts).
- **REMINDER: don't include the names of individuals or companies** who requested the feature. However, if there are notes in the crm, you can link to them.
